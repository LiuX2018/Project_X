%TRANSFORM3DRAYDATATO2DCOORDINATE COnverts the 3d ray data to 2d local
%coordinate formed by the base ray and plane perpendicular to base ray
%  baseRayDirection,baseRayPoint,secondaryRayDirection,secondaryRayPoint:
%  direction cosines and points on the base and secondary ray (3x1 vector)
%  refrencePoint: point through which the plane perpendicular to the base
%  ray passes
% The function is vectorized and so can accept 3xN inputs and gives 3xN
% outputs

% Compute the distance of the intersection point of the given points along 
planePoint = refrencePoint;
planeNormalVector = baseRayDirection;
baseRayIntersection = computeLinePlaneIntersection(baseRayPoint,baseRayDirection,planePoint,planeNormalVector);

% base ray
